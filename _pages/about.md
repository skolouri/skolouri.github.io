I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN. I run the [Machine Intelligence and Neural Technologies (MINT) lab](http://lab.vanderbilt.edu/mint-lab), focusing on mathematical machine learning, (geometric) deep learning, and computational optimal transport. Before joining Vanderbilt University, I was a research scientist and principal investigator at HRL Laboratories, Malibu, CA, where I was the PI and Co-PI on multiple DARPA programs. I obtained my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University and received the Bertucci Fellowship Award for outstanding graduate students from the College of Engineering in 2014 and the Outstanding Dissertation Award from the Biomedical Engineering Department in 2015.<br>

I am recruiting motivated PhD students with strong mathematical background to work with me on topics aligned with my lab's ['research directions'](http://mint-vu.github.io/about/). Masterâ€™s and undergraduate students within Vanderbilt University and visiting scholars are always welcome. Please refer to my lab's [website](http://mint-vu.github.io/resources/) for more information.
