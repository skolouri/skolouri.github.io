I am a research scientist and principal investigator at HRL Laboratories, Malibu, CA. My research lies in the intersection of applied mathematics, machine learning, and computer vision. I am currently the PI on DARPA Learning with Less Labels (LwLL) and the Co-PI on DARPA Lifelong Learning Machines (L2M) programs. Before joining HRL, I was a post-doctoral researcher at Carnegie Melon University. I received my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, where I received the Bertucci Fellowship Award for outstanding graduate students from the College of Engineering in 2014, and the Outstanding Dissertation Award from the Biomedical Engineering Department in 2015.
