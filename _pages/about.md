I am an assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science at Vanderbilt University. My research is motivated by the challenges facing today’s machine learning (ML) algorithms for deployment in critical physical world applications. My research lab, Machine Intelligence and Neural Technologies (MINT), focuses on creating the next generation of core machine learning algorithms that are mathematically grounded, uncertainty aware, label-efficient, and can continually learn from the nonstationary and never-ending data stream.  Among recent directions that my team and I have contributed to are: 1) single and multi-agent lifelong learning machines as part of three Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) programs, 2) uncertainty-aware deep learning as part of the DARPA Enabling Confidence program, 3) geometric deep learning, and 4) applications of optimal mass transportation theory in ML and computer vision. I am an inventor of over 20 issued patents and have over 50 published articles in high-impact machine learning, computer vision, and signal processing journals and conferences.
