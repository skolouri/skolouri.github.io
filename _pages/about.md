I am a research scientist at HRL Laboratories, Malibu, CA. My research lies in the intersection between applied mathematics, machine learning, and computer vision. Before joining HRL, I was a a post-doctoral researcher at Carnegie Melon University. I received my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA in 2015. I received the Bertucci Fellowship Award for outstanding graduate students from Carnegie Mellon College of Engineering in 2014, and the Outstanding Dissertation Award from the Biomedical Engineering Department in 2015.
