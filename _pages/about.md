I am a research scientist at HRL Laboratories, Malibu, CA. My research lies in the intersection of applied mathematics, machine learning, and computer vision. Before joining HRL, I was a post-doctoral researcher at Carnegie Melon University. I received my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, where I received the Bertucci Fellowship Award for outstanding graduate students from the College of Engineering in 2014, and the Outstanding Dissertation Award from the Biomedical Engineering Department in 2015.

## News

- I will be giving an ECE Seminar talk at Carnegie Mellon University on Feb 14'th, 2019, on the topic of ["Generalized Sliced-Wasserstein Distances and Their Applications in Generative Modeling and Transfer Learning"](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/news-and-events/seminars.html).
- Our paper ["Sliced Wasserstein Auto-Encoders"](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=H1xaJn05FQ) got accepted to ICLR'19 - Dec 21 2018
- Our paper ["Discovering Molecular Functional Groups Using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00265.pdf) is now available on arXiv - Dec 6 2018
- Our proposal titled, ['Super-Turing Evolving Lifelong Learning ARchitecture (STELLAR)'](http://www.hrl.com/news/2018/07/19/stellar-system-will-enable-autonomous-systems-to-learn-for-life), was funded by DARPA. Dr. Hava Siegelmann is the program manager leading the Lifelong Learning Machines (L2M) program at DARPA. The HRL team is led by Dr. Praveen Pilly and I and consists of academic members from six world-renowned universities - July 2018
